-- Distributor operational chargebacks (short_ship, late_delivery)
-- that do not join back to a triggering fulfillment event. Phase 3
-- Group C2 generates every distributor operational chargeback FROM a
-- shipment event; a row with no matching event means the causal chain
-- broke (a regression to the pre-causal pattern, where operational
-- chargebacks were independent random draws).
--
-- Join rules mirror the generator (scripts/seed_distributor.py,
-- generate_operational_chargebacks):
--   short_ship    -> a shorted shipment line, same distributor + SKU,
--                    chargeback month = ship month
--   late_delivery -> a shipment delivered beyond the order-to-door
--                    window (po_date + 12 days; distributor orders
--                    carry no requested_ship_date, so the window is
--                    the observable MABD analog), same distributor,
--                    SKU on its shipped lines, chargeback month =
--                    delivery month
--
-- The 12-day window mirrors DIST_DELIVERY_WINDOW_DAYS in
-- scripts/seed_config.py (frozen block). There is no
-- receiving_discrepancy category on this channel (design §1.6: no
-- receipt lines — distributor discrepancies arrive via deductions).
-- The kept quality-linked chargebacks (damaged, pricing_error) are out
-- of scope: they are quality-weighted legacy draws, not fulfillment
-- events.
