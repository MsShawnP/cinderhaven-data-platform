-- Operational chargebacks (short_ship, late_delivery,
-- receiving_discrepancy) that do not join back to a triggering
-- fulfillment event. Phase 3 Group C generates every operational
-- chargeback FROM a shipment or receipt event; a row with no matching
-- event means the causal chain broke (a regression to the pre-causal
-- pattern, where operational chargebacks were independent random
-- draws).
--
-- Join rules mirror the generator (scripts/seed_retailer.py,
-- generate_operational_chargebacks):
--   short_ship            -> a shorted shipment line, same retailer +
--                            SKU, chargeback month = ship month
--   late_delivery         -> a shipment delivered past the retailer
--                            MABD window (requested ship + max transit
--                            + OTIF window), same retailer, SKU on its
--                            shipped lines, chargeback month = delivery
--                            month
--   receiving_discrepancy -> a carrier_damage / quality_rejection
--                            receipt line, same retailer + SKU,
--                            chargeback month = delivery month
--
-- The MABD values mirror RETAILER_TRANSIT_DAYS (upper bound) +
-- RETAILER_OTIF_WINDOW_DAYS in scripts/seed_config.py (frozen block).
-- Path A data-defect chargebacks (label_fine, damaged, pricing_error)
-- are out of scope: they are triggered by product-data defects
-- (triggered_by_field), not fulfillment events.
