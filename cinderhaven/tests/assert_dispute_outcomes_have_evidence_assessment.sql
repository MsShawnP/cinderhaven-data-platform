-- Disputes whose outcome does not join to a coherent §2.5 evidence
-- assessment. Phase 3 Group D derives every dispute's evidence tier as
-- the weakest link across real fulfillment factors and conditions the
-- outcome on that tier; a violating row means the causal chain broke
-- (a regression to the pre-causal pattern, where evidence quality was
-- a random label and outcomes were a flat draw).
--
-- Two violation classes, mirroring the generator
-- (scripts/seed_retailer.py assemble_evidence /
-- scripts/seed_distributor.py assemble_evidence):
--
--   missing assessment — the dispute does not join to the fulfillment
--     rows the assessment is assembled from (deduction -> order ->
--     shipment [-> pack record, POD evidence row retailer-side]), or
--     its filing date precedes the deduction.
--   tier exceeds a derivable factor — the stored evidence_quality is
--     STRONGER than a factor visible in the warehouse allows. Under
--     the weakest-link rule the tier can never exceed any factor:
--     ASN not sent / POD missing => weak; ASN late, POD partial,
--     manual-count pack, filing 31-60 days => moderate at best;
--     filing > 60 days => weak. The product-data factor is seed-side
--     (defect-profile score) and can only LOWER a tier, so it cannot
--     create a violation here — tiers below the visible-factor minimum
--     are expected, tiers above it are impossible.
--
-- Tier ranks: strong=0, moderate=1, weak=2. Violation: stored rank <
-- a derivable factor's rank.
