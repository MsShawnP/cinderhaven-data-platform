"""Canonical revenue export — single source of truth for all Cinderhaven projects.

Queries Postgres for every revenue metric at every standard time window,
broken down by retailer. Output: JSON + CSV that any project can reference
instead of computing its own figures.

Usage:
    1. Start Fly.io proxy:  flyctl proxy 5432 -a cinderhaven-db
    2. Run:  python scripts/export_revenue_truth.py
    3. Output:  output/revenue_truth.json + output/revenue_truth.csv
