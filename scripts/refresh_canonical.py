"""Refresh this repo's vendored canon + gate from the cinderhaven-data-platform.

Copies the platform's synced artifacts into this repo:
  reference/canonical_values.json  (the machine-readable canon; tests read it)
  reference/supersedes.txt         (retired-figure list; the drift gate reads it)
  scripts/check_canonical_drift.py (the drift gate itself — synced so every repo
                                    runs the SAME, current gate implementation)
  scripts/refresh_canonical.py     (this script — self-syncs so the next refresh
                                    is always the latest version)

The platform regenerates the two reference artifacts on every
`verify_canonical.py` run; the two scripts are maintained in the platform's
scripts/. This is a DEV-TIME tool: run it after the canon or gate changes,
review the diff, commit the vendored copies. It is NOT part of CI (the vendored
files are committed).

Platform location resolution, in order:
  1. $CINDERHAVEN_PLATFORM (path to the platform repo root)
  2. common relative layouts from this repo
Fails loudly if it can't find the platform — never silently vendors nothing.
